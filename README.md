Mpox-AISM: AI-Mediated Super Monitoring for Forestalling Monkeypox Spread
Summary: 
The challenge on forestalling monkeypox (Mpox) spread is the timely, convenient and accurate diagnosis for early-stage infected individuals. Unfortunately, the similarity of common dermopathy and the professional detection needs inevitably deteriorated the diagnosis in window period and contributed to its widespread outbreak in crowded areas.Here, by taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) on similarity recognition of Mpox’s clinical phenotype, we propose a remote and real-time online visualization strategy, called “Super Monitoring” to construct a low cost, convenient, timely and unspecialized diagnosis of early-stage Mpox. Such AI-mediated “Super Monitoring” (Mpox-AISM) invokes a framework assembled by deep learning, data augmentation and self-supervised learning, as well as professionally classifies four subtypes(Grade I, II, III, Others) and two stage of Mpox(Earlier stage, Later stage) according to dataset characteristics and evolution trend of Mpox and seven other types of dermatopathy with high similarity.As verified, the Recall rates of Grade I, II and Earlier stage for Mpox diagnosis achieve 98·59%, 100·00%, 100·00%, respectively. Precision, Recall, Specificity and F1-score of Mpox achieve, respectively 99·3%, 94·1%, 99·9%, 96·6%. Precision, Recall, Specificity and F1-score of Mpox images of which max probability values predicted by system >= 0.6(The threshold of the terminal system obtained from the predicted probability distribution) reach, respectively 99·3%, 95·9%, 99·9%, 97·6%.Our results show that with the help of cloud service on Internet and communication terminal, Mpox-AISM can be potentially utilized for the real-time detection of early-stage Mpox in various scenarios including entry-exit inspection in airport, family doctor, rural area in underdeveloped region and wild to effectively shorten the window period of Mpox spread.
